# Data Visualization in R with ggplot2 

Learn how to create advanced visualizations in R with the ggplot2 package. We will learn the Grammar of Graphics, the underlying design philosophy that underpins ggplot2â€™s layered graphics. In this workshop, we will become familiar with the ggplot2 syntax, learn how to use it to develop more complex plots, and create statistical data visualizations.
