## Workshop guidelines

.pull-left[
- **Help** is always available.
  - Use the Zoom chat (private or public) to ask a question.
  - Raise your hand `r emo::ji('raised_back_of_hand')`.
  - And you can always un-mute and ask.

## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device." — John Tukey*

- Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data.
- There are many tools for visualizing data (R is one of them), and many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations (**ggplot2** is one of them, and that's what we're going to use).

## ggplot2 $\in$ tidyverse

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",fig.align="center"}

- **ggplot2** is tidyverse's data visualization package
- The `gg` in "ggplot2" stands for Grammar of Graphics
- It is inspired by the book **Grammar of Graphics** by Leland Wilkinson

## Grammar of Graphics

A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic.

## Hello ggplot2!

- `ggplot()` is the main function in ggplot2 
- Plots are constructed in layers
- Structure of the code for plots can be summarized as
```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```
- For help with the ggplot2

## Parameters of a full ggplot2 visualization:

- `data`: the data frame to be plotted
- `geometry`: how the data is to be displayed (e.g., scatterplot, barplot, etc.)
- `mapping`: how the properties of the data map to the properties of the geometry (e.g., which columns map to X and Y coordinates)
- `stat`: the transformation to apply to the data (e.g., count the number of observations)
- `position`: how to adjust the positions of displayed elements (e.g., jittering points in a scatterplot)
- `coordinate`: whether to use Cartesian coordinates or polar coordinates
- `facet`: how to subset the data to create multiple subplots
- `theme`: themes control the display of all non-data elements of the plot

## Mapping

- A **mapping** describes how to connect features of a data frame to properties of a geometry, and is described by an aesthetic.

```{r out.width="60%", warning=FALSE}

       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +           #<<

## Additional variables

We can map additional variables to various features of the plot:

- aesthetics
    - shape
    - colour
    - fill
    - size
    - alpha (transparency)
- faceting: small multiples displaying different subsets

# Aesthetics

---

## Aesthetics

An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. 

```{r out.width="50%", out.height="30%", echo=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(1, 1), size = 20) +
  geom_point(aes(2, 1), size = 10) + 
  geom_point(aes(3, 1), size = 20, shape = 17) + 
  geom_point(aes(4, 1), size = 20, color = "blue") + 
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, limits = c(0.5, 4.5), labels = NULL) + 
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, limits = c(0.9, 1.1), labels = NULL)
```

You can convey information about your data by mapping the aesthetics in your plot to the variables in your dataset.

---

For example, you can map the colors of your points to the `gender` variable to reveal the gender of each individual.

.small[
```{r out.width="60%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, 
                     color = gender)) + #<<
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)",                             
       y = "Weight (kg)")                            
```
]

---

## Aesthetics options

Visual characteristics of plotting characters that can be **mapped to a specific variable**
in the data are

- `color`
- `size`
- `fill`
- `shape`
- `alpha` (transparency)

---

We can map the size of points to the `birth_year` variable to reveal the birth_year of each individual.

.small[
```{r out.width="60%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars,

## Mass vs. height + gender

Let's now increase the size of all points *not* based on the values of a 
variable in the data, i.e. **set** size instead of **map** size:

.midi[
```{r out.width="63%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) #<<
```
]

.your-turn[

For the following code:

```{r gender-color-shape, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, 
                     y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

- Map the variable `sex` to both point color and shape. What do you notice?
- Try mapping a categorical variable to x, for example `eye_color`. What happens?
- Try mapping a continuous variable to shape, for example `mass`. What happens?

## Aesthetics summary

- Continuous variable are measured on a continuous scale
- Discrete variables are measured (or often counted) on a discrete scale

aesthetics    | discrete                 | continuous
------------- | ------------------------ | ------------
color         | rainbow of colors        | gradient
size          | discrete steps           | linear mapping between radius and value
shape         | different shape for each | *shouldn't (and doesn't) work*

- Use aesthetics for mapping features of a plot to a variable, define the 
features in the geom for customization **not** mapped to a variable

- `theme_gray()`: The default ggplot2 theme
- `theme_bw()`: A high-contrast dark on light theme, good for projector use
- `theme_minimal()`: A minimal theme with no background annotations
- `theme_classic()`: A simple theme with x and y axis lines and no gridlines
- `theme_light()`: A theme with light grey lines and axes, designed to direct attention to the data
- `theme_dark()`: A dark background theme to make colored lines pop

Look through the next three slides titled Facet 1, 2, and 3 describe what each plot displays. Think about how the code relates to the output.

**Note:** The plots in the next few slides do not have proper titles, axis labels, etc. because we want you to figure out what's happening in the plots. But you should always label your plots!

# Identifying variables

---

## Types of variables

- **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively. 
- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering. R uses the term 
**factor** for most categorical data.

Set `position='dodge'` to enable side-by-side barplots.

```{r out.width="65%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(y = gender, fill = hair_color2)) +
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge')
```

## Segmented bar plots, proportions

```{r out.width="65%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(y = gender, fill = hair_color2)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "proportion")
```

.discussion[
Which bar plot is a more useful representation for visualizing the relationship between gender and hair color?

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = gender, fill = hair_color2)) +
  geom_bar()
```

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = gender, fill = hair_color2)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "proportion")
```
