## Your Turn 0 - Using RMarkdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
## My code
```

Modify the setup chunk to import the **tidyverse** library:

```{r setup}
## My code
library(tidyverse)
```


## Your Turn 1 - Explore the data

Using `head`, `glimpse`, or `skim`, answer:
- How many **variables** are present?
- How many **observations** are present?
- How many **numeric** variables are present? What are they?

```{r}
View(starwars)
```

## Your Turn 2 - Mappings

1. Modify the code below to plot height vs. birth_year. See `?starwars` for the definition of `birth_year` in this context.

```{r height-birth-year}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = birth_year)) +
  geom_point()
```

2. You should observe that a few observations appear to be outliers. Can you guess who those characters are? Hint: Run `View(starwars)` in the Console to take a look at the raw data.


## Your Turn 3 - Aesthetics

1. Map the variable `sex` to both point color and shape. What do you notice?
```{r gender-color-shape}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, 
                     y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

2. Try mapping a categorical variable to x, for example `eye_color`. What happens?

```{r categorical-to-x}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, 
                     y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

3. Try mapping a continuous variable to shape, for example `mass`. What happens?

```{r categorical-to-x}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, 
                     y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Your Turn 4 - Themes

1. Modify the following plot to use a `theme_minimal()` theme.
```{r themes}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, 
                     y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
# My theme
```

2. Modify the below plot to:
- Add a plot title "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters"
- Add the plot subtitle "by gender and birth year"
- Add the x-label "Height (cm)"
- Add the y-label "Weight (kg)"
- Set the axis tick labels to size 14
- Set the axis titles to size 16
- Set the plot tile to size 18


```{r themes}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, 
                     y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "test", subtitle = "test2") + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = ),
        axis.title = element_text(size = ),
        plot.title = element_text(size = ),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = ),
        legend.position = )
```
