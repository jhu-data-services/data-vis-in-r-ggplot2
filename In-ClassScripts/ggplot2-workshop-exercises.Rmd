## Your Turn 0 - Using RMarkdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
## My code
```

Modify the setup chunk to import the **tidyverse** library:

```{r setup}
## My code
```


## Your Turn 1 - Explore the data

Using `head`, `glimpse`, or `head`, answer:
- How many **variables** are present?
- How many **observations** are present?
- How many **numeric** variables are present? What are they?

```{r}
head(starwars)
```

## Your Turn 2 - ggplot2

1. Modify the code below to plot height vs. birth_year. See the help for the data frame for the definition of `birth_year` in this context.

```{r height-birth-year}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```
